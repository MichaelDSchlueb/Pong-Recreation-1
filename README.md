# Pong-Recreation-1
For my CMS 495 Graphics class, I created a working replication of the game Pong, developed with Python's PyGame library for 2D graphical programming and Object-Oriented Programming to represent each asset as an instance of a class. I was primarily motivated to take on this project to explore foundational concepts for game development, which included the importance of Object-Oriented Programming and how it streamlines the development process by encapsulating data and objects together.

In this project, I developed complex algorithms to ensure seamless movement of balls and paddles across the screen, combining them with the drawing methods and capabilities of PyGame.

Getting Started:

1. Ensure Pygame is installed on your machine
2. Download each of the class files, including the main.
3. Type the command to begin the program from your command window.
